The stars were out, twinkling in the midnight sky.
A cool breeze whispered through the trees.
She stepped out of the cabin, her lantern flickering.
The forest was quiet, except for the sound of crickets.
Somewhere in the distance, an owl hooted.
"It's so peaceful out here," she thought.
The path stretched out before her, dark and mysterious.
Shadows danced in the pale moonlight.
Her heart raced as she heard a rustling sound.
"Who's out there?" she called, her voice trembling.
